5) In 1723, near the village of Egoshihi on the banks of the Egoshiha River, Vasily Tatishchev began the construction of a copper smelting plant, which was named the Egoshihinskiy Copper Smelting Plant. The plant started production the following year. After 13 years, in 1736, construction of the Motovilikhinskiy Copper Smelting Plant began near the Egoshihinskiy plant. For a long time, the two plants operated together, but in 1788, the Egoshihinskiy plant was closed. The Motovilikhinskiy Copper Smelting Plant continued its operations until 1863 when it was also closed. Today, the remnants of these plants include the Motovilikhinskiy Pond on the Bolshaya Motovilikha River and the building of the plant management, which currently houses a bakery.
